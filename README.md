This is a simple calculator program in Rust that performs basic arithmetic operations.
It takes two numbers and an operation from the user, performs the operation, and prints the result.
It includes functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It also handles user input and output, ensuring that the program is interactive.
The program uses the standard input/output library for reading user input and printing results.
The code is structured to be clear and easy to understand, with separate functions for each operation.
The program is designed to be run in a Rust environment and will prompt the user for input
before performing calculations. It includes error handling for invalid number inputs and operations.
The program is a good example of basic Rust syntax and functionality, demonstrating how to work with
user input, perform arithmetic operations, and handle errors gracefully.
This code is a complete, functional Rust program that can be compiled and run to perform basic
arithmetic calculations based on user input.
It is a good starting point for learning Rust and understanding how to build simple command-line applications
that interact with users.
The program is structured to be modular, with separate functions for each arithmetic operation,
making it easy to extend or modify in the future if additional operations are needed.
The use of `match` for operation selection allows for clear and concise handling of different operations
based on user input, providing a good example of Rust's powerful pattern matching capabilities.
The program is designed to be user-friendly, prompting the user for input and providing clear output
that indicates the result of the calculation.
The code is well-commented, making it easy to follow and understand the flow of the program.
It is a practical example of how to implement a simple calculator in Rust, showcasing the language's
capabilities for handling user input, performing arithmetic operations, and managing program flow.
